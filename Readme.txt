There are three inputs when you start the program
1: Original
	This is the text that will be translated, unencrypted or encrypted
2: Mode
	This is where you clarify what you wish to do with the text
		e for ENCRYPT is when you have a series of characters that you wish to make unreadable
		d for DECRYPT is when you have a servies of unreadable characters what you wish to translate

3: Shift
	This is where you clarify what key number you wish to shift the phrase by, up to 25, since 26 loops back to the beginning

If you get an error, the program will pop up with a statement that states
	invalid entry, try again?
	If you say y, you restart the process
	If you say n, it kills the program
